# An Introduction to Cryptography for Blockchain

## 1. Introduction to Cryptography

- Definition and objectives of cryptography
- History of cryptography
- Types of cryptography
    - Symmetric-key cryptography
        - Block ciphers (e.g., AES, DES)
        - Stream ciphers
    - Asymmetric-key cryptography (public-key cryptography)
        - Public-key algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECC)
        - Digital signatures

## 2. Hash Functions

- Properties of hash functions
- Common hash functions (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-3)
- Applications of hash functions in blockchain
    - Merkle trees
    - Proof-of-work

## 3. Digital Signatures

- Purpose of digital signatures
- Generation and verification of digital signatures
- Applications of digital signatures in blockchain
    - Transaction authentication
    - Smart contracts

## 4. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

- Overview of ECC
- Advantages of ECC over RSA
- Applications of ECC in blockchain
    - Digital signatures
    - Transaction security

## 5. Cryptographic Protocols

- Secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL)
- Authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth2)
- Distributed consensus protocols (e.g., Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake)

## 6. Cryptographic Security

- Common attacks in cryptography
- Cryptographic key management
- Post-quantum cryptography
