# Blockchain Architecture

We have covered the high level philosophy and innovation behind both Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Let's now look at blockchains in a more technical and architectural way to set up for the exercises we will do later.

## Context: Node

A blockchain node is a single instance of the blockchain software. If you run the Bitcoin client on your computer, you will act as a one of many nodes on the network. The decentralized and permissionless nature of nodes keep blockchain systems resilient to attack.

In these next subsections, we will review architectural concepts which exist within the view of your single node.

### Blocks

### Transactions

### Storage

### State Machine

## Context: Network

### Peer-to-Peer Network

### Forks
